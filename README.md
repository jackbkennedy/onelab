# Welcome

This is the v.0 release of the "onelab" python package. It is a proof on concept package for easily interfacing with the [gmsh](http://gmsh.info/) and [onelab](http://onelab.info/) clients using python. A more detailed version of the documentation will follow along with examples of how the api can be used and various extensions to create a better user experience. Currently the package only contains the apis as distributed [HERE](https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/gmsh).
